  ## Project Idea
  We will design and implement a Linux Live Response Digital Forensics Collector, using Bash scripting. The tool will perform read-only evidence collection on a running Linux system, preserving forensic artifacts while maintaining forensic integrity.

In addition to the baseline system's artifact collection, the tool includes a persistence detection module that identifies common Linux persistence mechanisms employed by attackers, such as scheduled tasks, startup scripts, and other methods.

This project will demonstrate how scripting can automate forensic workflows while adhering to core principles of digital forensics, such as data integrity, repeatability, and chain of custody.
